    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I am really starting to get bored m8</p>
    <p>Like, I understand the need for a second page, but a third one really?? ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>bruh</li>
    <li>just</li>
    <li>your phone</li>
    <li>internet</li>
    <li>some money left on your account</li>
    <li>an app capable of completing such a difficult and complex task as ORDERING FOOD?!</li>
    <li>and some salt, just in case</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<p>No sugarcoating here babe</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Find out what you want to eat.</strong> Sounds easy, but just wait till you really have to make the final decision. (´・ω・`)</li>
    <li><strong>Preheat your oven to 550 degrees F</strong>, or as high as it will go (at least 475.) Let the stone preheat for 30 minutes. I don't care when your oven beeps to tell you it's at temperature. Set a timer, 30 minutes at least!</li>
    <li> Whoopsies, forgot to delete the previous one. Sue me.</li>
    <li><strong>Whip that overpriced phone of yours out</strong>, and try to locate that app that always seems to be on a different page.</li>
    <li><strong>Order. What. You. Choose. Like. 2. Steps. Ago?</strong> Hope you are still smart enough for this one, or your phone really has some worrying advantage over you in IQ.</li>
    <li><strong>Tip that poor delivery guy.</strong> For god's sake, the man just rode through the hell of a raging snowstorm on a damn scooter just so you can have some pizza that you were not able to prepare based on recipe #2. ಠ~ಠ</li>
    <li><strong>EAT.</strong> Better than anything you could ever cook, right?</li>
    <li><strong>Try to survive the next 42 minutes.</strong> Overeating aint no joke now, huh? ｡◕‿‿◕｡</li>
</ol>

<p>ps. don't take this as a personal offense, I'm addressing myself with this one</p>
