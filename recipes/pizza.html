    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I love this Easy Homemade Pizza Recipe! I have been perfecting this recipe for years. It is quick to put together and so versatile. I’ll give you lots of tips, tricks, and ideas to get the best homemade pizza to ever come out of your wimpy, not-wood-fired oven!</p>
    <p>No need for fancy descript... oh wait what have I done (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 16 ounce ball of pizza dough</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil - IYKYK ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)</li>
    <li>1 cup pizza sauce </li>
    <li>3 ounces thinly sliced mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>5 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese </li>
    <li>2.5 ounces pepperoni </li>
    <li>2 tablespoons shredded parmesan cheese</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<p>Just trust me and blindly follow the following steps ;p</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Place a pizza stone</strong> in the bottom third of your oven. (place a rimmed baking sheet or a pizza pan in the oven if you don't have a stone.)</li>
    <li><strong>Preheat your oven to 550 degrees F</strong>, or as high as it will go (at least 475.) Let the stone preheat for 30 minutes. I don't care when your oven beeps to tell you it's at temperature. Set a timer, 30 minutes at least!</li>
    <li> <strong>Prepare a work surface.</strong> I prefer to rub my counter with oil, but you can lightly dust it with flour if you have a very sticky dough. (Too much flour can turn your dough tough.)</li>
    <li><strong>Roll out the dough.</strong> Place your ball of pizza dough in the center of your prepared work surface and use your hands to press it down, starting from the center. Keep gently patting out the dough, moving the dough outward from the center. I usually use my hands for pizza dough, gently patting and stretching (and yes, picking it up and maybe even tossing!), but you can also use a rolling pin. Make sure to keep rotating the pin so that you get a roughly circular shape. It doesn't have to be perfect! Even if you have used a rolling pin, I like to use my fingers afterward to shape the edges into a thicker crust.</li>
    <li><strong>Transfer the dough to a square of parchment paper.</strong> I highly recommend using parchment paper because it’s SO much easier transferring your pizza into the oven. You can pick it up carefully with your hands and rearrange it on the paper, or wrap it around your rolling pin to help transfer. (I've tried rolling the dough out directly onto parchment paper. It doesn't work well.) Make sure you stretch out the dough so that it is about 12 inches.</li>
    <li><strong>Par bake. </strong> Once the oven is up to temperature, we are going to do a 1 to 2 minute par bake. This step is technically not necessary, but I never skip it. It guarantees not only a thoroughly cooked crust, but a nice and crispy one. Nobody wants a doughy pizza, yuck. (If you want to skip it, you can proceed with topping your pizza). </li>
    <li><strong>Top your pizza. </strong> Leave the crust on the peel while you add your toppings. </li>
    <li>and so on, holy hell how difficult could it be to make a simple pizza smh (ノಠ益ಠ)ノ彡┻━┻</li>
</ol>
